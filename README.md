# ConfigEditor
Too lazy to go to a folder and edit configs? Do it directly in game !

### Description
Have you ever thought of how long the process is just to change something in your config?	
No? Then here is a sample:	
- Go to your VPS/your computer where the server is hosted.
- Search the plugin folder
- Open the config with your code editor (wait for it to open)
- Search the data you want to change
- Change it
- Save the config
- Reload your server because most plugins doesn't auto refresh.

Would you like to shot this long process into a simpler and much faster one?	
Then, this plugin is for you allowing to change your configs right in game/in the console.	

#### What does makes ConfigEditor faster than this process?
* No need to search for the folder, you just enter the plugin name.
* Just go to your server instead of going to your VPS
* Instant config opening.
* Easy data setting by name.
* Auto reload the config in the plugin if possible.

### How does it work?
The config editing process works by commands. 	
First of, open the config in game using /opencfg <plugin name> <file of the config eg: config.yml>.		
Then, if the config opening has been succefull. 	
You can, set, see, add, delete data from the config using /cfg <set|get|del> <key> [value...] 	
You can see the whole content of the config using /cfg read. 	
Then, when you finished your editing, save the config using /cfg save (will auto reload in the selected plugin if possible) 	
And just after than close your config using /closecfg.
